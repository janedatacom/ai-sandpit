# MasterClass

This repository hosts twelve chapters of hands-on material for the Datacom AI MasterClass series. Each chapter folder follows the same pattern:

- `Lab`: guided scenarios that reinforce the chapter concepts.
- `Activities`: open-ended prompts to explore additional angles.
- `Exercises`: short practice tasks for repetition and mastery.

See [LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for student-facing lab instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Pick a chapter folder (Chapter01 through Chapter12).
2. Review the lab brief inside `Labs/` then complete the Activities and Exercises.
3. Commit your progress frequently and keep lab write-ups inside the relevant subfolder.

## Next Steps

- Add lab instructions, sample solutions, and datasets to each folder as they are developed.
- Update this README with per-chapter summaries once content is ready.
- Configure CI or linting once code artifacts appear in the labs.
