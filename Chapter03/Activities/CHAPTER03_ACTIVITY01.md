# Chapter 03 — Activity 1 (What are the layers?)

[Back to all lab instructions](../../LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Duration**: ~14 minutes (facilitated)

## Goal

Identify the layers in the **Datacom AI Pyramid** and describe what each layer is responsible for.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this activity you can:

- Describe the purpose of each layer in the Datacom AI Pyramid
- Explain how the layers relate to each other (what sits “on top of” what)
- Identify limits and potential of the platform as a shared capability

## Prerequisites

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Pyramid handout | Printed (best) so participants can write on it |
| Pen | One per participant |
| Capture method | Camera/scan + upload to the Datacom AI Sandpit (or shared folder) |
| Timebox | Keep to the time windows to maintain momentum |

> Facilitator note: Don’t “teach” the pyramid first — let participants attempt it, then use the discussion to correct and align.

## Activity steps

![Activity: overview](assets/slide-00-overview.png)

### 1) Think (0–2 minutes) — what are the layers and what is their purpose?

- [ ] Individually scan the pyramid and the icons.
- [ ] Based on what you’ve learned so far, guess the **layer names**.
- [ ] For each layer, write a short purpose statement:
  - [ ] What does this layer provide?
  - [ ] Who uses it?
  - [ ] What problem does it solve?

---

### 2) Write (2–7 minutes) — fill in the handout

![Handout: fill in the blanks](assets/handout-datacom-ai-pyramid-fill-in-the-blanks.png)

- [ ] Write your name on the handout.
- [ ] Fill in the layer names.
- [ ] Add a short purpose statement for each layer (1–2 lines).

Tip prompts:
- “If this layer disappeared, what would break?”
- “What capability does this layer hide/simplify?”
- “What does this layer need from the layer below?”

---

### 3) Scan (7–9 minutes) — convert physical to digital

- [ ] Take a photo/scan of your completed handout.
- [ ] Make sure the text is readable.
- [ ] If you’re working in groups, include all names.

---

### 4) Mark (9–11 minutes) — upload to the Datacom AI Sandpit

- [ ] Upload your photo/scan to the agreed location (Datacom AI Sandpit / shared folder).
- [ ] Use a consistent filename (suggested):

  `Chapter03_AI_Pyramid_<TeamOrName>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.png`

---

### 5) Discuss (11–14 minutes) — what did you notice?

![Step 5: Discuss](assets/slide-05-discuss.png)

- [ ] Compare answers between pairs/tables:
  - [ ] Which layer was easiest to name?
  - [ ] Which layer was hardest?
  - [ ] Where were the disagreements?
- [ ] Discuss as a whole group:
  - [ ] What are the pyramid’s biggest **limits** today?
  - [ ] What’s the most valuable **potential** if used well?

Optional closing questions:
- “Which layer do you interact with most often?”
- “Where would you want more self-service or guardrails?”

---

## Facilitator notes (optional)

- Keep people moving — this is a fast alignment activity.
- If participants get stuck naming layers, redirect to purpose: “What does this part *do*?”
- Use the follow-on lab to ground the discussion in hands-on experience.

### Answer key (optional)

Canonical layer names (top → bottom):

- Interface Layer
- Orchestration Layer
- Inference Layer
- Training Layer
