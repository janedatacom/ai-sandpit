# Chapter 2 — Activity assets

Drop Chapter 2 screenshots/images into this folder so the chapter markdown can reference them.

## Activity 1 (current slide filenames)

These are the filenames currently referenced by the markdown:

- `slide-01-title.png`
- `slide-02-step1-think.png`
- `slide-03-step2-write.png`
- `slide-04-step3-group.png`
- `slide-05-step4-filter.png`
- `slide-06-step5-discuss.png`

If you add more screenshots (e.g., photos of the physical sheets), use a consistent pattern (e.g., `c2-activity1-issues-sheet.png`) and then reference them from `Chapter02/Activities/CHAPTER02_ACTIVITY01.md`.
